# Devlogger
A devlogger web app made with a Udemy course

This is a very simple web app made with Angular which simply strengthened my skills with the use of the framework. 

To run the web app run these in the CLI within the folder:

npm install
#Installs all the dependancies (You must have node package manager installed for this to work)

ng serve --open
#Compiles the code and opens index.html in the browser

(ctrl + c to end)
